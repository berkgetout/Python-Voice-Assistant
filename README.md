Our voice assistant detects the user's voice and responds in Turkish. Additionally, it has a calendar event or reminder feature. Users can add events to the desired time, and the assistant will notify them when the time comes.

Project Information:
1.1) Main Screen: There is a simple and user-friendly main screen. An animation is triggered each time the assistant speaks, and there is a commands section.
1.2) Voice Recording: This is the part that handles the voice recording process. It uses Google Speech to recognize Turkish from the "SOURCE," listens to the incoming sound, records it, and stores the result in the "AUDIO" variable.
